### Download

A Windows version can be downloaded in the [release section](https://github.com/fhaer/Decentralized-Process-Modeling-and-Instance-Tracking/releases/). Further versions for Linux and macOS will follow shortly.

Please note that this first release is an alpha version for demonstration purposes. 

### Demonstration Setup
When the program is started, a new ethereum wallet can be created, or, a pre-defined one - registered with the program's smart contract - can be chosen. Furthermore, when the Add button on the left hand side is clicked, the dialog to add a remote repository suggests a link to a Git repository. This repository is set up with process models of a supply chain use case.

The smart contract is deployed in the Ethereum testnet at address [0x44838c369f4c7f781bb6b14df3c45f5b4797af0d](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x44838c369f4c7f781bb6b14df3c45f5b4797af0d).
